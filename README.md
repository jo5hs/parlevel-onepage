* Section child elements have '.feature' and '.content.col'

Buttons & Graphics
------------------
* There are backup primary 'contact' buttons and icons available in the /img folder in case you don't like the css3 styling of the buttons or prefer images over webfont for icons
* Sliced images were used for the form icons that appear in the input fields instead of webfont
